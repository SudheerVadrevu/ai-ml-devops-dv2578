# Build AI Agents with CrewAI and Local LLMs for Kubernetes Research (2025)

## Introduction

In today’s rapidly evolving DevOps and Cloud landscape, AI agents are becoming powerful allies for engineers. Unlike traditional AI assistants like ChatGPT that require step-by-step input, AI agents can work autonomously, execute complex tasks, and even coordinate with other agents to deliver a complete output. In this article, we explore how to build multi-agent systems using **CrewAI**, an open-source framework that supports **local large language models (LLMs)** such as **LLaMA**.

We will walk through a hands-on project where two AI agents collaboratively research and summarize the **latest trends in Kubernetes** for 2025. This use case demonstrates how DevOps Engineers can use AI agents to automate documentation, trend analysis, and blog generation—all without relying on costly or potentially insecure enterprise APIs.

## What Are AI Agents?

AI agents are autonomous software programs designed to perform tasks independently or with minimal human intervention. They are different from AI assistants like ChatGPT in the following ways:

| Feature                | AI Assistant (e.g., ChatGPT)                     | AI Agent (e.g., CrewAI)                          |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Task Execution         | Requires step-by-step instructions              | Executes complete tasks autonomously             |
| Autonomy               | Low                                              | High                                             |
| Collaboration          | No                                               | Supports multi-agent collaboration              |
| Use Cases              | Conversational Q&A                              | Project automation, report generation, research  |

**Example**: While ChatGPT can help you write parts of a Terraform script, an AI agent can build the entire EKS cluster by stitching tasks across multiple agents and automating the flow.

## Why Use CrewAI and Local LLMs?

### Key Benefits of CrewAI:

- Open-source and easy to use
- Supports **multi-agent orchestration**
- Works seamlessly with **local LLMs** (e.g., LLaMA via Ollama)
- No vendor lock-in or API costs
- Avoids security risks tied to cloud-based AI APIs

> “CrewAI is ideal for engineers and organizations that want AI automation without sending data to third-party cloud providers.”

## Use Case: Kubernetes Trend Research Using Two AI Agents

### Problem Statement

Your organization wants to analyze the **latest Kubernetes trends in 2025** and summarize them into a structured blog report.

Traditionally, a senior Kubernetes engineer or data analyst would manually perform this research. Today, we’ll delegate this task to two AI agents:

1. **Researcher Agent** – Conducts Kubernetes trend analysis
2. **Reporting Analyst Agent** – Summarizes insights into an MD file

---

## Step-by-Step Guide to Building the AI Agents

### 1. Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 – 3.13
- LLaMA 3.1 or higher installed using [Ollama](https://ollama.com/)
- CrewAI Python package

### 2. Setup the Environment

```bash
# Create project directory
mkdir crew-example && cd crew-example

# Create Python virtual environment
python3 -m venv crew
source crew/bin/activate

# Install CrewAI
pip install crewai
```

### 3. Initialize CrewAI Project

```bash
crewai create devops-ai-project
```

You’ll be prompted to choose an LLM provider. Choose **Ollama**, and select **LLaMA 3.1** if it's already installed.

> If not installed, run:
```bash
ollama pull llama3
```

## Key Configuration Files

### `agents.yaml`

Defines the persona and behavior of each agent.

```yaml
- name: kubernetes_researcher
  role: Senior Kubernetes Data Researcher
  goal: Uncover cutting-edge developments in Kubernetes
  backstory: |
    You are a seasoned Kubernetes researcher known for discovering and presenting
    the latest trends in a clear, structured format.

- name: kubernetes_reporting_analyst
  role: Kubernetes Blog Writer
  goal: Generate a detailed Markdown blog from research findings
  backstory: |
    You specialize in transforming research into engaging, technically accurate reports.
```

### `tasks.yaml`

Defines task allocation to each agent.

```yaml
- agent: kubernetes_researcher
  task: Research 2025 Kubernetes trends and output top 10 findings

- agent: kubernetes_reporting_analyst
  task: Expand the 10 findings into a structured blog in Markdown format
```

---

## Running the Project

### 1. Update the Topic in `main.py`

```python
topic = "Kubernetes"
```

This will be passed to the agents dynamically.

### 2. Install and Run the Project

```bash
crewai install   # Installs dependencies and sets up environment
crewai run       # Executes both agents and generates reports.md
```

### 3. Output

- A `reports.md` file is generated with Kubernetes trends.
- Can be uploaded to GitHub, published on a blog, or included in internal documentation.

---

## Sample Output (from `reports.md`)

```md
# Kubernetes Trends for 2025

1. Enhanced support for multi-cluster networking
2. AI-powered observability tooling
3. Native integration of eBPF for better performance
...
10. Edge-native Kubernetes distributions
```

*Note: Results may vary based on your LLM version (e.g., LLaMA 3.1 might not have the most recent 2025 data).*

---

## Best Practices

- Always use a Python virtual environment to isolate dependencies
- Keep your local LLM updated for accurate results (e.g., LLaMA 3.3+)
- Avoid sharing sensitive data with cloud APIs—use local LLMs where possible
- Customize agent roles and backstories to align with your organization’s goals
- Use `crew.py` only if you need custom agent workflows; otherwise YAML is enough

---

## Real-World Use Cases for AI Agents in DevOps

- CI/CD pipeline generation
- Terraform infrastructure creation
- Kubernetes documentation and changelog generation
- Security vulnerability analysis
- Blog and wiki content automation

---

## Conclusion

AI agents like those built with CrewAI represent the future of DevOps automation. By leveraging **open-source frameworks** and **local LLMs**, engineers can reduce manual effort, maintain data privacy, and rapidly generate insightful documentation or automation scripts.

This project is a perfect entry point for DevOps Engineers to understand how AI agents work in real-world DevOps workflows. Stay tuned for upcoming projects where we’ll automate Terraform deployments and CI/CD pipelines using multi-agent orchestration.
